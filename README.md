## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## How to Run

1. Install Visual Studio Code, JDK, and JavaFX
2. Install the VS Code extensions "Language Support for Java(TM)", "Extension Pack for Java", "JavaFX Support", and "Code Runner"
3. Download and unzip this project, then open the parent folder in VS Code
4. Rename the `vscode` folder to `.vscode`
5. Go to the `JAVA PROJECTS` view and follow [these instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies)
6. Click the dropdown arrow beside the run button at the upper right corner, then click `Run Java`


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
